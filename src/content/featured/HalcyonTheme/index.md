Welcome to China Bristro. This is a React-Redux powered single-page web applcaiton. I leveraged Reactstrap for Bootstrap 4-based responsive UI design, and various aspects of React components for page layout. I used React router for page navigation, and the Flux architecture and Redux for state management. Fetch library and RESTs API were implemented for client-server communication
