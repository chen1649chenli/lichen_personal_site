CorkBoardIt is an online forum for creating CorkBoards, filling them with pictures, and sharing them with your friends. CorkBoardIt is a simplified site from Pinterest with support for the most important features of an image organization and sharing site: users, CorkBoards, Pushpins (to attach a picture to a CorkBoard), and the ability to follow other users, watch CorkBoards, and comment on the images on CorkBoards.
